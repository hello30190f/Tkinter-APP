# Tkinter Apps
I try to make tkinter apps for practice.


# App list
- text writer
- video editer (There is no function. I designed UI. I will make function later....)
- paint (in test folder) 
- Char counter

# Folder structure
├─junk  
├─test  
│  ├─1  
│  ├─2  
│  ├─3  
│  ├─4  
│  └─6  
└─works  
│   ├─1  
│   ├─2  
│   └─3 (Char counter)  
│   └─4 (escape adder for path)  

# Recent event
- I add char counter of a web page. (Only count p tag content.)
- I still have no idea to treat video. Opencv,ffmpeg and moviepy are supposed to be useful for this purpose.
